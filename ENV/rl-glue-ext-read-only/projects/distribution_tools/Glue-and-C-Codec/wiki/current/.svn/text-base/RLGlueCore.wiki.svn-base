= Change Log =
== Version 3.04 ==
- Fixed a bug in the RL_network.c code where it would dereference a null pointer if an empty abstract type was sent into rlCopyADTToBuffer.  This bug would sometimes (some codecs) manifest if an episode was ended on the first call to env_step.  Thanks to Jason Williams for identifying this problem.
