#summary This page contains links and information about all of the current Matlab Codec downloads for RL-Glue.

*Notes:* To use this or any other codec, you must have RL-Glue Core installed first.

=== Available Downloads ===

 * [MATLAB-USER-DEV-LINK Matlab User/Dev Distribution MATLAB-USER-DEV-VERSION] [MATLAB-USER-DEV-DETAILS-LINK (File Details)]
 
  This is a platform-independent RL-Glue codec written in Matlab.  This codec builds on the Java codec to provide its functionality, so Matlab must be run with the Java Virtual Machine enabled (this is the default).  There is an automated installer script in Matlab that will add the RL-Glue m-files and Java classes to your path so they can be used easily by your Matlab programs.  It should install on most Linux and Unix platforms, including Mac OS X and on Microsoft Windows.

=== Quick Install ===
<code language="bash">
#Unpack the files
tar -zxf MATLAB-USER-DEV-FILE-BASE.tar.gz

#Start Matlab
#Change to unpacked directory
>>cd /path/to/MATLAB-USER-DEV-FILE-BASE

#Install the Codec
>>installRLGlue()

</code>
